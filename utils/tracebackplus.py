"""More comprehensive traceback formatting for Python scripts.

To enable this module, do:

    import tracebackplus; tracebackplus.enable()

at the top of your script.  The optional arguments to enable() are:

    logdir      - if set, tracebacks are written to files in this directory
    context     - number of lines of source code to show for each stack frame

By default, tracebacks are displayed but not saved and the context is 5 lines.
Alternatively, if you have caught an exception and want tracebackplus to display it
for you, call tracebackplus.handler().  The optional argument to handler() is a
3-item tuple (etype, evalue, etb) just like the value of sys.exc_info().
